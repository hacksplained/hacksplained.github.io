### Hi Hacksplainers 👋

My name is Hacksplained aka. PascalSec or just Pascal.

I am a professional penetration tester and video making enthusiast. In March 2020, I have started to create educational Youtube videos covering cybersecurity, bug bounty programs and hacking in general.

If you have not stepped by my Youtube account yet, make sure to do that right now - https://youtube.com/c/hacksplained

I am super grateful that I have found a medium where I can give something back to the community, of which I have learned so so much in the past.

If you want to help me carving out more time to produce even more videos, support me on any of the following pages :D
